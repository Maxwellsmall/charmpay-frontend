        To keep your account and funds safe, we may occasionally perform a
        Security Check. This process helps us verify your identity, prevent
        fraud, and ensure transactions are secure for everyone.

        Why Am I Being Asked to Complete a Security Check? You may be prompted
        for a security check if: You're logging in from a new device or
        location. A high-value transaction is being made. We detect unusual
        activity on your account. Youâ€™re updating sensitive account information
        (e.g., email, password, payment details).

        What Does the Security Check Involve? Depending on the situation, the
        check may include: Verifying your phone number or email. Entering a
        one-time passcode (OTP) sent via SMS or email. Confirming your identity
        with a government-issued ID. Reviewing recent transactions for
        verification.

        `}
        How Long Does It Take? Most security checks are completed within a few
        minutes. If manual review is needed (e.g., document verification), it
        may take up to 24 hours. Tips to Pass Security Checks Smoothly Use the
        latest version of the app. Ensure your contact info is accurate and up
        to date. Respond promptly to verification requests. Avoid using VPNs or
        proxies that may trigger security flags.
